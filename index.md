## Welcome! **Please Note: This website is till under construction :)**

I am a computational ecologist interested in networks, food webs, disease transmission, and how to do things on computers. I'm currently a MSc student in [Dr. Stephanie Green's lab](https://greenlab.ca/about/) at the University of Alberta. While this website is primarily for hosting information about my research, I also write tutorials and 'how-to' documents for doing fun things in Julia, Python, R, and whatever else strikes my fancy, which you can find [here](/software/).

Currently, my thesis work is focused on trying to understand how food webs are altered as the result of anthropogenic global change. I think about this topic both from a theoretical network perspective and also in the context of applied fisheries research. 

I have a keen interest in modelling cool ecological systems of all sorts, but I also spend a lot of time thinking more broadly about how we do science and who gets to participate. See more [here](/research/). I am also a passionate open science advocate - you can find all my code for projects I am leading on my [GitHub](https://github.com/colebrookson).

The work that I enjoy most involves collaborations with other folks who are interested in asking and answering ecological questions that are interesting from both a fundamental and applied perspective. I absolutely love working on a variety of things, and I'm always open to new projects, so please get in touch if you see an opportunity to collaborate on some awesome science!
