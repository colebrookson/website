## Welcome!

I am a computational ecologist interested in networks, food webs, disease transmission, and how to do things on computers. I'm currently a MSc student in [Dr. Stephanie Green's lab](https://greenlab.ca/about/) at the University of Alberta. While this website is primarily for hosting information about my research, I also write tutorials and 'how-to' documents for doing fun things in R, Python, and other languages, which you can find [here](/software/).

Currently, most of my work is focused on trying to understand how food webs are altered as the result of anthropogenic global change. I think about this topic both from a theoretical network perspective and also in the context of applied fisheries research. Despite food webs being my primary research focus, I have a keen interest in modelling cool ecological systems of all sorts, and thinking more broadly about how we do science and who gets to participate. See more [here](/research/).

The work that I enjoy most involves collaborations with other folks who are interested in asking and answering ecological questions that are interesting from both a fundamental and applied perspective. I absolutely love working on a variety of things, and I'm always open to new projects, so please get in touch if you see an opportunity to collaborate on some cool science!
