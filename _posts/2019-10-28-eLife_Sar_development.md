This was a project mainly driven by the [Ruiz-Trillo group](http://multicellgenome.com/) in Barcelona, and especially Omaya Dudin and Andrej Ondracka. Omaya beautifully documented by imaging how the syncytial cell of _Sphaeroforma arctica_ undergoes cellularization to release new daughter cells, while Andrej characterized the transcriptome dynamics. My PhD student Arthur Haraldsen visited the lab in 2018 and helped out on the transcriptome sequencing, genome annotation and lincRNA identification.
