Finally our study on microRNAs and their biogenesis machinery in ichthyosporeans is published in Current Biology.  

This was a project we started many years ago. In 2016 we published an [early version](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/01/076190) of the paper on _bioRxiv_, but it was not until Phil Donoghue, Kevin Peterson and IÃ±aki Ruiz-Trillo provided crucial pieces of data and help on the evolutionary interpretations that we managed to really lift the impact of the paper.

See more details from the paper more [here](/publications/miRNA_Current_Biology), or check it out on the Current Biology [website](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31063-7#%20).
