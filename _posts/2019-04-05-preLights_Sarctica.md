[preLights](https://prelights.biologists.com/) recently highlighted our [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/563726v1) on the development and cellularization of the ichthyosporean _Sphaeroforma arctica_. You can check it out [here](https://prelights.biologists.com/highlights/a-unicellular-relative-of-animals-generates-an-epithelium-like-cell-layer-by-actomyosin-dependent-cellularization/). It's a really nice piece, and I especially enjoyed the Q&A section about epithelia and cellularization with Omaya, Andrej and IÃ±aki.

See the figures of our pre-print [here](/publications/01-2019-Sar_development/).
