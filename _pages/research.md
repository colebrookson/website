# Research

Very broadly, I am interested in modeling and forecasting the way that ecological communities interact with s under novel anthropogenic conditions. my research is focused on modelling and forecasting the interactions between organisms across scales, and trying to understand how those interactions are being altered by anthropogenic activity. I enjoy working on both applied and fundamental problems, most often but not exclusively in the world of marine ecology. Whatever the system/question I'm working on, I am a very big advocate of Open and Reproducible Science, so whenever possible, I prefer to make both papers and the associated data open access. All my code is open and can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/colebrookson).

## Current Research

#### Food Webs

My primary research interest right now is focused on simulating how food webs are being altered as a result of anthropogenic global change. At a whole food web level, I’m interested in the process of food web *rewiring* wherein the removal or addition of species into a food web causes the network structure of that food web to shift. Specifically, I’m modeling how we can better predict how rewiring rewiring will occur under increased global change. Species traits provide a convenient and well-studied way to think about this problem, as they allow us to mechanistically qualify the interactions between predators and prey. **I use simulation approaches and mathematical models to ask how different types of perturbations affect the near- and long-term dynamics of trait-based food webs.**

In a more applied sphere, I am also working to model the changes in diet of an economially important fishery, Albacore tuna. We are currently trying to develop a better understanding of how Albacore switch which prey they are consuming as a function of both abiotic factors, and biotic characteristics (i.e. traits) of their prey items. By comparing trait-based predictions of Albacore diet to real data, we are trying to develop more accurate models of what Albacore will be eating as abiotic conditions continue to change, and in turn, what this means for them as a valuable fishery species.

#### Environmental Contaminants

Physical contaminants such as microplastics (plastic particles <5mm) and other anthropogenic debris are common and harmful pollutants in aquatic systems globally. While we are gaining an understanding of how anthropogenic debris affect individual organisms, it is less clear what effect these persistent pollutants have on populations as a whole. In collaboration with folks from the [Rochman Lab](https://rochmanlab.com) at the University of Toronto, I am modelling the effect of microplastics on populations of a freshwater invertebrate *Daphnia magna*, with the intention of better understanding how the effects of microplastics affect a mixed-life stage population of organisms.
