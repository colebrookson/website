# Research

My research is focused on developing computational approaches to model and forecast interactions between organisms in the context of anthropogenic change. I enjoy working on a range of topics, but most of my MSc work has focused on modeling food web rewiring. I have previously worked on modeling the effects of pathogens & pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, and am currently thinking a lot about host-parasite interactions. Whatever the system/question I'm working on, I am a very big advocate of Open and Reproducible Science, so whenever possible, I prefer to make both papers and the associated data open access. All my code is open and can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/colebrookson).

## Current Research

#### Food Webs

My primary research interest right now is thinking about how food webs are being altered as a result of anthropogenic global change. At a whole food web level, I’m interested in the process of food web *rewiring* wherein the removal or addition of species into a food web causes the network structure of that food web to shift. Specifically, I’m interested in how rewiring processes might vary depending on the type of perturbation the food web is exposed to. Species traits provide a convenient and well-studied way to think about this problem, as they allow us to mechanistically qualify the interactions between predators and prey. I use simulation approaches and mathematical models to ask if different types of perturbations change may cause food webs to rewire in a predictable way, and if so, how can we forecast this with respect to populations of interest?

In thinking about applying these concepts, I'm focusing on modeling how the diet of Albacore tuna may be changing with increased temperature change in their oceanic habitats. I am currently trying to develop a better understanding of how Albacore switch which prey they are consuming as a function of both abiotic factors, and biotic characteristics (i.e. traits) of their prey items. By comparing trait-based predictions of Albacore diet to real data, I am developing more accurate models of what Albacore will be eating as abiotic conditions continue to change, and in turn, what this means for them as a valuable fishery species. This specific project is in collaboration with folks at UAlberta & [Stanford University](https://crowderlab.stanford.edu/), and is funded by the [Lenfest Ocean Program](https://www.lenfestocean.org/en).

#### Environmental Contaminants

As a carry-over from previous research interests, I am currently involved in a project developing a statistical modeling approach to scale up individual-level toxicology data to population-level models. Physical contaminants such as microplastics (plastic particles <5mm) and other anthropogenic debris are common and harmful pollutants in aquatic systems globally. While we are gaining an understanding of how anthropogenic debris affect individual organisms, it is less clear what effect these persistent pollutants have on populations as a whole. In collaboration with folks from the [Rochman Lab](https://rochmanlab.com) at the University of Toronto, I am modelling the effect of microplastics on populations of a freshwater invertebrate *Daphnia magna*, with the intention of better understanding how the effects of microplastics affect a mixed-life stage population of organisms.
