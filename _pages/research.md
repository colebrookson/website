I am currently a Master's student in [Dr. Stephanie Green's lab](https://greenlab.ca) at the University of Alberta, where I'm working on understanding how species traits can be used to better understand how food webs and trophic relationships will be altered as a result of global change. 

In 2019 I completed my H.BSc at the University of Toronto, where I worked with Drs. [Chelsea Rochman](https://rochmanlab.com), [Martin Krkošek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca), and [Marie-Josée Fortin](https://fortin.eeb.utoronto.ca).
